  <p> Everyone feels sad or down sometimes, especially during tough times. Feeling sad or
upset is a normal reaction to difficult situations. But, if you have these feelings intensely
for long periods of time and are having trouble with normal activities, you may be
experiencing depression. </p>

<p>Depression weighs heavily on many men. It can pull your thoughts into
dark places, leaving you questioning your purpose, role, and abilities.
Here are some common thoughts men with depression have, and what you
can do about them:</p>


<p class="headings"><b><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> I MUST BE WEAK TO HAVE BECOME DEPRESSED.</b></p>
<p>No, you’re not weak. Depression is a serious illness that should not be
underestimated; it’s the leading cause of disability worldwide. Depression
affects athletes, veterans, teachers, doctors, musicians, CEOs, tradesmen
– depression doesn’t care who you are. It can affect anyone and has
nothing to do with personal strength or weakness.
 Watch our real stories and see what real strength in the face of
depression looks like.</p>
<p class="headings" ><b><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>  I SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO MORE.</b></p>
<p>Fighting depression is hard. When you’re depressed you probably won’t be
able to do as much as when you’re healthy – but that’s okay. Walking
around the block can feel like running a marathon when you’re depressed.
Give yourself some slack and appreciate for all the efforts you make.Focus on what you are able to do, in spite of depression. Even
completing small or partial tasks can take a lot of energy, and it takes
practice and patience to appreciate this.</p>

<p class="headings"><b><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> I DON’T THINK DEPRESSION IS WORTH TALKING
ABOUT.</b></p>
<p>Sometimes you need an outside perspective for a different take on what
might be contributing to your depression. Talking about it can pull you away
from your thoughts and lessen the strain you’re under.
Reach out to a friend or family member, call a healthline, or consult a
doctor. There are tons of people out there who can help.</p>

<p  class="headings"> <b><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> I AM A BURDEN ON OTHERS. </b></p>
<p>You aren’t the burden, the weight of depression is. Family, friends, doctors,
and other mental health professionals can help you bear the weight. The
people that care about and love you will want to help; hiding from them will
only makes things worse.Share the load. Reach out to build supports to help you through this
tough time. When you’re feeling better you can repay the favours. Learn
how to reach out to friends and family.</p>
<p class="headings"><b><i class="fa fa-dot-circle-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> I EITHER FIGURE THIS OUT OR I END MY LIFE.</b></p>
<p>This is all-or-nothing thinking taken to the extreme; “ending it all” is no
solution. Depression and thinking about suicide are nothing to be ashamed
of. Many guys have worked through thoughts like these and gotten back to
better health. If you recognize yourself thinking only in absolutes, use this as a warning
beacon. Alert yourself to how distorted your thoughts are and recognize
that you are no longer in a position to view your health objectively.We know how hard it is to fight depression, so we cannot stress this
enough –  be proud of any steps and progress you make, even if it takes
longer than you hoped.
Recovering from depression takes time. The new habits and skills you
learn now will you help throughout your life.</p>

<h3><p><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> HOW TO HELP A DEPRESSED FRIEND</p></h3>
<p>Let the person talk<br>
It’s not unusual for someone to disclose their own challenges when you speak to
them about your own. This is a sign of trust and mutual understanding. If you want to
be heard, you need to listen. Hear out whatever your friend or family member has to
say. Be as patient with them as you want them to be with you.<br>

Not everyone will understand (and that’s okay)<br>
Not everyone understands what depression is or how to help out with someone who
has depression, so don’t take it personally if someone doesn’t seem to “get it”.

If it doesn’t work, try again
The first person you talk about depression with might not be able to lend a hand in
the way you hoped for, but it doesn’t mean that there aren’t others out there who can
help out. Keep looking and talking. With time, you’ll figure out who is best to connect
with for a little support.<br>
Be realistic<br>
Each person you approach has his or her own life and responsibilities. If someone
isn’t as helpful as you hoped, it might simply be a reflection of how busy they are
with things going on in their life.<br>

Show your appreciation<br>

Sometimes the help that people provide is not exactly what we needed.
Nevertheless, it’s good to express your thanks. The person will feel respected and
be more apt to lend a hand in the future, if you ask for it.

“If you have been feeling like your struggling with depression, it’s ok to tell
me your not ok and I will stand with you in any way I can. I mean it, I’m
really here for you.”
“I’ll help you find a counselor. Whatever you need me to be, in that moment
I’ll do my best because I love you. Nothing you say will make me think less
of you.”
“I will pray hard, standing in the fight with you. I will never give up on you
and I want to help you to not give up on yourself.”
“If your depression ever makes you feel like giving up this fight, you can
talk to me about those thoughts too.”
“If suicide is something that ever crosses your mind, you can talk to me
about those feelings”<br></p> -->

<h2><p><i class="fa fa-heart-o" aria-hidden="true"></i>  The What’s of Depression</p></h2>
<p>If a heart feels like they are broken, worthless, no good for anyone and it
meets with a mind of a person struggling with depression then the outcome
can be tragic.
You may think that is a little too drastic to call it tragic…but have you been
there? I have.
I have not only been there, but I’ve also been there to listen to countless
humans struggling with depression that pour out the devastation they are
going through, baring their heart and soul.
Our individual bodies play a role in this subject of depression. There are
many studies to support the fact that depression is an illness. There is so
much to the causes of depression but I don’t want to make this post about
the why’s of depression but instead the what’s of depression.
What depression feels like. What we can look for as symptoms of
depression in our self or someone else. <br>What we can do for ourselves and

for those in our lives struggling in this war on the heart, mind, soul and
body.
So basically <strong>ALL OF YOU</strong> is fighting. Some are fighting and some have just
about given up.</p>
